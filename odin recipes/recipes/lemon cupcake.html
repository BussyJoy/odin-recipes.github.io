        <h2>Lemon Cupcake Recipe Made Easy</h2>
        <p>Here is a recipe I use for beautifully delicious <em>lemon cupcakes.</em>
             Ideally, you'd use buttercream frosting to ice cupcakes, 
             but I tried these with Lemon Cream Icing for a less buttery icing,
            and they were perfect! These cupcakes are truly 
            lighter than air and will melt in your mouth.</p>

        <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> 3 cups self-rising flour</li>
            <li> ½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li> 1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
            <li> 2 cups white sugar</li>
            <li> 4 eggs, at room temperature</li>
            <li> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li> 2 tablespoons lemon zest</li>
            <li> 1 cup whole milk, divided</li>
            <li> 2½ tablespoons fresh lemon juice, divided </li>
            <p><strong>lemon cream icing</strong></p>
            <li> 2 tablespoons lemon zest</li>
            <li> 1 cup whole milk, divided</li>
            <li> 2½ tablespoons fresh lemon juice, divided</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <h4>STEPS</h4>
        <ol>
            <li> Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). 
                Line 30 cupcake pan cups with paper liners.</li>
            <br>
            <li> Sift the self-rising flour and salt together in a bowl. 
                In another bowl, beat the unsalted butter and sugar with an electric mixer 
                until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time,
                 beating each egg until incorporated before adding the next. 
                Mix in the vanilla extract and lemon zest.</li>
            <br>
            <li>  beat the flour mixture into the butter mixture,
                 one third at a time, alternating with half the milk and half the lemon juice after each of the first 2 additions of flour. 
                Beat until just combined; do not over mix.</li>
            <br>
            <li> Fill the prepared cupcake liners with batter 3/4 full,
                 and bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 
                 about 17 minutes. Let the cupcakes cool in the pans for about 10 minutes before removing 
                  them to finish cooling on a rack.</li>
            <br>
            <li> To make the icing, beat the cream in a chilled bowl with an electric mixer set on Low until the cream begins to thicken. Add the confectioners' sugar and lemon juice, a little at a time, beating after each addition, until fully incorporated. Increase the mixer speed to High, 
                and beat until the icing forms soft peaks, about 5 minutes. 
                Spread on the cooled cupcakes. Refrigerate l.</li>
